<h3>POC</h3>
The goal of this proof-of-concenpt is to create virtual environments to instruct learners. This example in particular is about bashing.
But, the goal is to create tutorials in general 

<h3> Building </h3> 

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/rymarinelli/poc.git
```

<h4> Navigate to root of the directory</h4>

```{bash}
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

The application will be running on port 80:80. The plan is to deploy on heroku in the future.
