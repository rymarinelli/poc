        <h1>Hashing</h1>
        <p>The goal of this exercise is to introduce hashing. A hash takes an input(a key) and applies a function to get an output. The output mains a mapping to the originial input. 
           The goal of hashing typically is based in encryption, but it has many purposes. There are data structues called hash maps that use hashes for quicker access to data, and hashes are 
           used to ensure data quality during transfer. These are checksums.
        </p>

        <p> We will focus on three well-known hashing algroithms.
          <li> MD5</li>
          <p> A hashing algroithm that is no longer secure. It is used in other applications. It is historically significant</p>
          <li> sha-256 </li>
          <p> A popular hashing algroithm that is still considered secure. It is much stronger that MD5</p>
          <li> sha3-512</li>
          <p> A much newer algroithm. It produces much more output than SHA-256 and is much more secure. </p>
        </p>

        <h1> Experiment</h1>
        <p> 
          When hackers get access to passwords they are typically hashed, so they cannot be read. They are encoded with a hashing algroithm.
          One tool that is used to decode hashes is hashcat. It is already installed in the terminal. A word list is also included. A word list 
          is a list of frequently used passwords. Hashcat tries to encode the list of password and compared the encoded password that is known 
          to the password that is trying to be found out. If they match, then the password can be decoded. About a fifth of passwords 
          can be determined this way. This is in part why pass phrases are useful.
